**Pulse-Lang**
Pulse-Lang is an easy to use and  powerfull Programming language built using rust which compiles into Rust code to support memory safety, multiple system architectures and allowing fast code executions.

**The Node system**
Pulse-Lang is going to use a system using nodes (comparable to multiple visual programmign languages), which allows an easy understanding of the code and makes adding new nodes as simple as writing a rust function (so really really hard).
